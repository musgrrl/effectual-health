My grandmother used to say, "Get rid of the weight before age 40 or else!" I now understand what she meant. It becomes much harder to lose weight in your 40s than in your 30s or 20s. But Why? Have you ever asked yourself that question? Or do you just blame it on age?

I am a curious person and want to know what age has to do with changes in my weight so that I can do something about it! At Effectual Health, we will get the bottom of these questions and touch on many health topics that will help you have the excellent health you deserve.
