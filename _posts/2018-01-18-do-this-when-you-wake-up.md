Drink lemon water when you first wake up.Â If you do this every day, it will help to detoxify your body and lose weight.

Lemon water is a part of a morning ritual for many health-conscious people. It is full of antioxidants and many have touted it as part of a weight loss regimen, but how does it work?

According to <a href="http://www.thehealthsite.com/fitness/lose-belly-fat-quickly-with-these-7-kitchen-ingredients/">thehealthsite.com</a>, lemon water helps a stressed liver by detoxifying it. It helps to get your liver back in tip-top shape so that it can burn fat effectively.

Lemon water can help to boost your metabolic rate. As this rate increases, your body burns more calories, which can play a role in weight loss. It also acts as an appetite suppressant because it contains pectin, a fiber that is contained in lemons and other fruits. It helps to make you feel full longer.

Lemon water can also remedy low stomach acid production which can cause acid reflux, bloating, gas and facial redness. Drinking this before meals can kick-start the stomach into making enough acid.
