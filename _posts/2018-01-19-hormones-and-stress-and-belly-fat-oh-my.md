Yes, stress can affect your hormones which can also have a negative effect on your metabolism. Who hasn't heard of the stress eater? My dad used to have an extremely stressful job (teaching middle school) which sent him flooring it to McDonald's after work before going home.

Close your eyes and fill your lungs with air. Breath out slowly:
