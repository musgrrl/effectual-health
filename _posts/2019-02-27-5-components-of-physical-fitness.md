<p>I write about weight loss, but I also like to keep in mind that there is more to good health than losing weight.  Making sure we have the right amount of muscle, fat, and bone is called <strong>Body Composition</strong>.  Making sure our muscles can perform before fatiguing is called <strong>Muscle Endurance</strong>. <strong>Muscle Strength</strong> is the amount of force our muscles can produce.  <strong>Flexibility</strong> is the range of motion of your joints or the ability of your joints to move freely and the mobility of your muscles to move without restrictions. <strong>Cardiovascular endurance</strong> is how efficiently your heart, blood vessels, and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to working muscles during physical activity.<br><br>There are ways to test each area of fitness to make sure you are in good health: </p>
