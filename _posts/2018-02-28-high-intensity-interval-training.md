A while ago I sent my DNA into one of those companies that uses your DNA to give you information about yourself.  I simply cannot remember the name of the company, but I remembered that the report told me I should do High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).  It was the first time I had even heard of it.  I ignored this advice at the time because it sounded like hard work and I didn't want to make my workouts more intense.  Fast forward to 2018 and now I am older and a bit heavier than I was back then. I have less time to workout and my body doesn't respond to walking alone.  I was made aware of HIIT again and this time I was ready.
<h4>What is HIIT?</h4>
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a combination of brief, very-high-intensity bursts of cardio exercise followed by equal or longer periods of rest.
<h4>How long should the HIIT session last?</h4>
The average time for a session is 20 minutes. This includes the warm-up.
<h4>How many sessions in a week?</h4>
In the beginning, you may only want to do one session per week until your body gets used to the intensity level of these workouts. As you begin to get used to it, replace your cardio workouts with HIIT but be sure not to do more than three sessions per week.
<h4>What types of exercises are in HIIT?</h4>
Here are a few of the exercises you might see in a HIIT session.  Also listed by some of the exercises are the modifications for those who may have knee, hip or other joint issues.

<h4>Mobility Exercises</h4>
Mobility exercises are warm-up exercises that help prevent joint pain when doing intensive exercises such as HIIT.  The main joints that are at risk are knee, ankles, hips, and wrists. Doing mobility exercises before your HIIT session will reduce the risk of wearing out your joints.  Also doing <a href="http://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/best-mobility-exercises-mobility-wod/">mobility exercises</a> on the day between HIIT workouts will help as well.
