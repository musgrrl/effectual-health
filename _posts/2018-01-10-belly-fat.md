Belly Fat. It's uncomfortable, unhealthy and ugly. If you are like me, just looking at a piece of cake can make your belly expand. Abdominal obesity increases your chances of developing diabetes, heart disease and even cancer which is a road no one wants to take.

So what can be done? Obviously, stop eating cake! But seriously? There are plenty of people who have curbed their sweet tooth, reduced the number of calories and who exercise that still have abdominal fat. H<span class="text_exposed_show">ere at Effectual Health, we are going to discover why those who are putting in so much effort are coming up short. Let's get started. First, you'll need to get your belly measurement. Get out your body tape measure. If you don't have one, you can purchase one from here:</span>

For women, if your waist measures 35 inches or more there is cause for concern.
For men, if your waist measures 40 inches or more it could spell trouble.

Don't worry. Facing the truth is the first step to better health.
